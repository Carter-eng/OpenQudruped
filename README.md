# OpenQudruped

This is the code that I am developing on my own to operate my quadruped.
The quadruped has twelve degrees of freedon handled by twelve servo motors
that range from 0 to 180 degrees.

My goal is to derive and define the movement myself. If a function or
piece of code is based on work I did not derive myself, I will be sure
to credit the creator. 

Once use is understood and defined I will write a user guide here as well.

The goal is to be ultimately able to use this robot with ROS to test new
and emerging robotic systems. This work is funded by and performed under 
the Boston University Robotics Laboratory

Documentation for derviations and testing can be found here
